## Introduction

This project is an example to showcase how to deal with local accounts, sending, receiving and creating new commits on a Speckle server using our C# SDK.

> If you're trying to run this you should have the .NetCore3.1 Runtime installed

### Running

This is a `dotnet core 3.1` console app, so just run:

```shell
dotnet run
```

### Creating your own

This is quite simple, just create a new console app:

```sh
dotnet new console -f netcoreapp3.1
```

And then add `Speckle.Core` as a dependency

```sh
dotnet add package Speckle.Core --version 2.5.2
```

And `Speckle.Objects` if you want to be able to create speckle specific objects.

```sh
dotnet add package Speckle.Core --version 2.5.2
```
