## Introduction

This project is an example to showcase how to deal with local accounts, sending, receiving and creating new commits on a Speckle server using our Python SDK aka `specklepy`.

> If you're trying to run this you should have python installed on your machine, and the latest version of `specklepy`. You can install it via `pip install specklepy`.

### Running

If running from the terminal, just run:

```shell
python3 YOUR_DESIRED_PYTHON_EXAMPLE.py
```

If you're using VSCode for editing, you can just press the `Play` button that will appear on the top-right corner while you're python file is open:

The button also has a dropdown to choose to debug the current script, which is quite handy to set breakpoints and inspect variable values.
